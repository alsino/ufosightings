      "body" : "There's a strange dark carnival and I go on some ride was up high, a shaky old abstract coaster ride. So scary. Something tragic or terrible happened and the place is shut down. It's silent as a graveyard- and maybe it is. I find myself in a building with a garage, I see Abrams car and somehow a parking ticket/receipt that verifies he's in the building. I'm surprised and nervous to find this. Why is this haunting me? I enter the building and head off wherever I need to go, there's some pieces of my laundry and very very oddly, I find my high school english teacher van diest- in a lower office. His face is redder than it ever was, and I recalled that he was sick, wondered subconsciously, if he was alive in real life :( we traded some strange banter and I remembered what a great man he was, especially to be teaching the brattiest age and class. I head out into a maze of a building and fine myself at some outdoor like spot. There someone there with me, female I think, and I deal I've my laundry has reappeared. Unfortunately it contains some unidentifiable male pieces, and I realize these are Abram's, and these are hockey. I'm puzzled and intrigued, it seems diest had something to do with it. I somehow wind up in a parking garage, looking to park the car. After a few turns and noticing wildly steep car lined twisty driveways that go very deep underground and various angels, I turn into what looks like reasonable spot. As I park I realize the space is very narrow and find myself and car frozen and locked at a terrifying sideways angle. I can't move, I can't breathe. I am still and wondering if the car will get me out of this. It won't. I notice a lady nearby and beg her for help, please can you help me for a second? I crawl towards something and she gives me just the support I need to get away. Now waiting at this strange bar concert thing trying to get in, he bouncer is mean and I didn't bring my wallet. I go back to get it and when I return he doesn't check.I'm nervous",

I had also bought paint but did not paint because we had to leave to get things which I don't remember what.\n\t\t\tMy mother was in the living room and we got into an argument but I don't ever remember exchanging words. I do remember that she had misinterpreted what I had said. I left the house with my cousins Corinne, Eden and my sister Melissa. We were in a blue van driven by Corinne. She ended up in the back of the van trying to remedy something about the TV thing I had melted together. I remember looking to the driver's seat and no one was driving. I yelled and tried to grab the wheel but it was too late. We drove off a huge embankment and grabbed my cousin Eden to protect her. We tumbled over and over again. I said,\"God, please help us\". \n\t\t\tOnce we landed at the bottom, we were all okay. We should have been dead but God had saved us. I was standing in front a church and there were people surrounding a table. They ignored me and wouldn't turn around. I saw my mother walking toward the river. Her hand was shaking and she was mute. Someone grabbed her before she went into the river. I was walking away from the church when I had collapsed. A 1st responder came over to help me. I was in shock. I saw the van and it was completely crushed. Again, I saw my mother walking. Her hand was shaking like she had Parkinson's disease. I ran up to her and asked her to forgive me. She did but no words were exchanged. She was older and not in her right mind. My mother and I get a long great so this is why this dream was so devastating.",

We were looking in garbage cans and dumpsters and picking out clothing that we thought we could clean and wear. We weren't poor or in need of new clothing, but this what we were doing. We found some things and then got in a car to look for parking, so we could go have a good time.\n\t\t\tWe couldn't find any in the French Quarter, so we drove out just a little ways and walked into the city. There were people all over. It was very crowded. We walked through a few stores and while in one, I put on the ratty old shorts that I had picked out of a dumpster. They smelled really bad and no one could believe I was wearing them without washing them first. They started to burn my legs a bit, so in another store I changed and threw them away. We walked up to an impressive hotel (that I have dreamed about before) with white marble statues and columns. It overlooked the river with fountains flowing into the river. \n\t\t\tAt that point, the dream shifted. We were in Walt Disney World and my ex was gone, but my dad was there. He asked if we could swim in the fountain/pool even though we were not guests of that hotel but were staying in another Disney property. The man, rather rude, said no. It was a small pool and for guests of that property only. We could go swim in one on the property we were staying in he said. I went ahead and jumped in the pool, in my clothing and splashed around. The man became angry and was shouting for security when I woke up.",

Three in particular. The first was a book for learning german, while the second was a book on biology and the third was a Japanese text book.

With my brother (who had appeared out of nowhere) We opened the band room doors and closed it as soon as the seagull had left, to stop it's return. During this time I felt nothing but fear when the seagull had gotten close to me. The piano man, who I have never met then started to follow me around and complain about music.

I didn't feel safe camping there with my family, so I moved.\n\t\t\tThere was an old building, like a wooden train station or mine with a guard kiosk between the two entrances. I passed the lady in the booth who gave me a key and said if I wanted to go up in the elevator again from going down, then I had to turn it in the lock. I went down in the elevator to the second underground floor, but just as I was going to turn the key in the lock to go up again, the elevator lurched and fell. I crashed down to the lower floor with about 7 people of various ages. We were all infected with a disease that could kill us. There was an antidote, but as we reflected, it could kill us or cure us. We didn't take the antidote for a while, focusing instead on having fun and loving life together. I thought about how scary it would be to be the last one to die if we all took the antidote together. Then a dark skinned, long haired lady in her 30s took the antidote first. I saw it fizz up into her skull and down into her chest. She sweat and she shook but she didn't die. She also wasn't cured.\n\t\t\tWe all took the antidote but weren't cured, so then we tried to escape. We finally got out of the place we were in, only to find we were in a bigger jail (with the appearance of real life) He",

It was quite detailed. There were two teams and the boys ran around, and they had either the option of kicking the ball or using their hands to throw it. At one point, the game was moving slowly and the boys at this time seemed to be smaller in size. Then one boy kicked the ball far, and the opponent\u2019s goal keeper was also not able to fetch it but luckily for him one of their backs retrieved the ball in time. All the while, there was this promising thought that now Indian kids were taking up rugby, and even though they were just starting off, there was now hope that India would shine in this sport!\n\t\t\tIn a weird sequence I  was crossing by someone\u2019s house, on the way  to meet my son someplace, as suddenly I wet my pants and then had to sneak into the house from a window, as I could see bedsheets that looked like a dhoti or cloth that I could wrap around myself. Inside the house I found a trouser and then I was sitting perched near the house, smoking a cigarette, when the owners came back and I had to sprint up a small hillside to escape from them. I entered a road that looked similar to one in a junior school that I had attended.

All of us randomly changed our appearances a lot wand we were all on a ladder trying to avoid gunfire but didn't want to go up and face mr.money yet. Eventually I got tired of waiting there and went up with a knife. I acted likes I was on an episode of shark tank and presented the knife  and then stabbed/cut all of them and then they were all dead.  No matter where I stabbed/cut they were sort of not dead but \"out of the game\" before this we had come to the silent agreement that whoever killed the owner of the house, they became the owner. I went looking around my new house and there was an ENORMOUS space filled with tables with buckets of candy. There must have been at least 500 different types! There were a ton of little children and kids running around grabbing/eating/taking the candy. I got really pissed and was yelling at them but some (my mother I think) just told me to let it go and I realized it was stupid and I could never eat that much and didn't even like candy that much. I went to go look for the official land ownership papers so I could be the proper owner. I found an employee(the house was looking more like a Walmart or petco now) to ask for the papers. They told me to go look for the [something] empress who would be down at the front desk. The front desk ended up being one of those podium/table things where people take reservations at restaurants.

Instead of helping the cop, the other man and I scramble into the lift, leaving the rest behind. We struggle with our conscience, opening the doors before they fully close a few times, but eventually allowing them to close. \n\t\t\tAs the lift moves, we hear gunshots and screaming, and we are stricken with guilt. I soon realize the lift has gone up to the 64th floor instead of down, and is making its way to the 62nd floor again.

      "body" : "I had a dream that must have taken place at least a year from current time. It was a zombie apocalypse and I'm assuming my mom had passed away because she wasn't mentioned or seen at all. I don't remember the beginning but from where I last remember me and my 14 year old sister Brianna were running from a heard of zombies outside and I was carrying something in a back pack, we get into the appartment building we live in and its fancy but run down because of the apocalypse. So we run in through the first glass doors (you know how most buildings have 2 sets of doors) and we lock the first ones and we both kind of laugh in relief, I think we were used to these kinds of close calls. But then we look into the main lobby and we see another zombie (just one) coming so we lock the second set of glass doors and now we are trapped in this little area with zombies on both sides. Then I realized that someone broke the glass on the inside door anyways so I just tell Brianna to run to the stairs. We run but the stairs are blocked by zombies so we run to the elevator and franticly press the 4th floor button and luckily the doors close in time. We laugh to ourselves for once again surviving a close call. Then when we get to the forth floor there is another zombie but it doesn't see us so we quietly walk to our room and go inside. No ones there and it looks how you'd expect, dark and dirty, cans and medical supplies everywhere, very post-apocalyptic looking room. I go to my bed and pull out a crossbow and a knife from my bag which I'm guessing is what I got from the trip. I think we ran out of ammo for our guns and so we were told to use knifes. I didn't want to use knifes and neither did Brianna because we didn't want to get close enough to a zombie to use one. So I thought the crossbow would be better, I could shoot at a zombie and if I missed a few times it's ok I have more arrows and then when it dies I can pick all the arrows up and reuse them. So once I set up the crossbow I give Brianna a knife just incase she needs it but I plan to kill the zombies myself with the crossbow. We walk down to the recreational room and in the closet are some craft supplies. We leave the door open so if any zombies come in we can practice using the crossbow and it will help us deal with unexpected zombies better. Brianna starts to draw a picture and I get out a red marker and start to draw drops of blood coming down from my hairline to my forehead and I have no idea why I did this and even Brianna laughed and asked what I'm doing. Then we decide to close the rec room door because were too paranoid about a zombie coming in to have fun so we close the door. I think I was drawing the blood to try and look like a zombie in an experiment to see if they would think I was one of them. We laughed for a bit and had a good time and then my dad came in and told us to come back to the room. When we went back we saw he had brought back food and we were super excited about that, we ate and then he got mad at us for going out today without him because we didn't have any weapons and it was dangerous. We went out without him because we wanted to get that crossbow but we knew he wouldn't let us take it because he wants us to be able to use knives. He's mad we got a crossbow instead of 2 knives too. He says we're going out after dinner to practice killing zombies with knives because it's important. I think that's was it, I can't remember anything else",

One of them wanted some inputs about the locality and to impress him I pointed out to one person with me who was familiar with this and could provide inputs. I pointed out this person who was standing at a distance talking with someone else. Even as we waited for this person to join us, he simply disappeared. This was bizarre because we were in a completely open area and he just could not have gone anywhere.\n\t\t\tIn another dream, which I had \u2018locked\u2019 and remembered instantly in the morning when I wanted to recollect the dreams, I was with friends \u2013 possibly school mates \u2013 and we were moving to our rooms to sleep. For some reason, we needed candles and since we were somehow passing through a close friend\u2019s room (Chops) I stooped to search a table in his room where candles should have been kept. In the other dream that I had also kind of \u2018locked\u2019 we were discussing about our uncles who had passed away and in my case the reference was to a maternal uncle who was still alive. In a lucid kind of way, I reflected that thinking this in a dream was not a good sign as far as the future well-being of this uncle was concerned \u2013 was this to be a premonition?\n\t\t\tI often remember dreams when I there is some activity in the day that connects with a dream that I have \u2018forgotten\u2019. Incidentally, I woke up this morning and wondered if my wife would make cold coffee for me to take to office today, instead of the other cold drinks that she routinely provides. And guess what, I reached office and took a sip of the drink and it was\u2026cold coffee!",

I went to the bottom of the underground \"hill\" and there was a huge tunnel leading to an even huger cavern. I could tell the tunnel was less sturdy then the main beginning area. Everything was made of dirt. No rocks. The cavern had a sort of stadium in it. Something I don't remember happened. I had to leave. I felt like the big tunnel was about to collapse so I was slowly crawling through it. The bottom of the original head open into a sort of porch/dock and everything was snowy and the dock was out onto an icy river. I decided I didn't want to risk going through the cavern and have it collapse on me so I decided to climb up the steep hill that covered the top of it. I made art on my way up and kept dropping down into the icy water but it didn't feel cold. I sees a face and wrote \"I write sins\" and then later on \"not tragedies\".

The layout was different, the wooden floor, the table and chairs by the side all were different. I might have looked through the blinds which i quickly sought to reset to their original position and left the apartment. On the other side there was a glass door and before i knew i was sort of floating through the door into the apartment. I floated gently with a steady pace pass several room with different people and things in them. One of the rooms had someone playing video games. The final room had a couple on a bed with the girl who had punk haircut. They were disagreeing or having a slight quarrel. I soon found myself back outside the apartment with a guy and a girl next to me. I was about to mention the whale but I thought it was a bit crazy so I didn't. Then the girl noticed my watch.

There was another person with him. Though I am not sure whether the person merged with dog at some times. The way they covered some grain stocks being warehoused with coverings of straw bundles etc made me wonder.\n\t\t\tIn a related sequence I saw my son crawling to the door and wrenching out with his teeth some decorative piece that was attached to it. While this piece seemed to have a cloth cover which I tore off and gave to him, I also pointed out some nails that were popping out. I moved his fingers to them to show how they were so pointed and dangerous and then I told him that he should never use his teeth to pull out anything, indicating that I had suffered some broken teeth. In another dream I was with my junior school friends and while there was much merriment in one instance I was sitting and observing the festivities on my own. When a girl came along with a camera, I suggested to her that I could take her photos. She gave me her camera, and then like in a previous dream some days ago, the camera seemed weird and though the zoom button seemed obvious it was hard for me to manage this camera. There was also a bunch of girls who saw me sitting alone and got up to join me.\n\t\t\tIn a fascinating sequence around here, I was star gazing with my school friends and there was this amazing constellation that I had never seen the likes of before. It was of human shape and had a big round belt in it. While I also observed Orion and the Great bear, this was stunning. Then we got into a debate whether these groups of stars were to be called constellations or galaxies, with a couple of my friends determined that they were galaxies. But when I asked one of them to explain why it was so, he was not able to say anything that was comprehensible. I was debating in my mind whether I should Google this! I think I had some other dreams featuring some of my regular dream elements such as touring, being with colleagues, visiting a toilet/hotel but had difficulty in remembering dreams beyond those that were early morning ones \u2013 even though I feel I had \u2018locked\u2019 one dream early on in the night.\n\t\t\tWoke up not so fresh and tired tonight!",

Edwin actually took some back and I have no idea how much money it was and I even said the terrence how much money did you did you give me so I could pay you back. He hadn't idea. Also I got about 5 pieces of cheesecake. It wasn't from them I'm not sure who it came from it just appeared. And I was remember thinking no one should get cheesecake when they get fired ,you should get real food because you're going to get sick from eating so much cheesecake. I didn't eat any. I'm not sure who else was there but they seemed to eat the cheesecake and I was fine with that. In a different scene I remember telling people why I got fired.

I was quoting some recent readings where it was said that one should not expect another to fulfil you. When even you cannot fulfil yourself how can one ask another to fulfil you? Etc etc. in free-flowing prose. Impressive! I think I locked one more dream but that one I have forgotten.\n\t\t\tIn the morning I had dreams that involved some ex-colleagues. I was at some kind of a conference venue with a junior  colleague when somewhere out of the woodwork a scrummy looking man with his son popped out of the woodwork. They apparently had some shady dealings with me in the past. I tried to ignore them and my colleague didn\u2019t notice them at first. But they reappeared on the street and we had a discussion about how we had done some deals earlier. I was curious to know if I owed him any money but he just passed off that question saying it didn\u2019t matter now. I somehow got away from them and then provided a long explanation to my colleague about how I was involved with them through an uncle of mine who was trading in chemicals etc and how we had failed in the project not because of monetary losses but because over 6 months of efforts and dedication had not led to any business success.",

At first I was in a darkened bar, as I moved to the mirror, a policeman with sunglasses talked to me saying that I needed to smarten up and as I stood there, comically, with my bowl haircut collected around my face and my shoulder pads high, I saw his point. I was a little drunk but smartened myself up and looked way better.\n\t\t\tNext I ascended a staircase in a bright white room and there was an old woman at the top of the stairs who showed me a short rope swing in front of the open door at the top of the stairs. It was sunny outside: the door opened to a meadows bluff high above a valley. She told me I needed to swing but that it was possible I might overswing and fall right over the bluff. I don't know why I agreed to do something so foolish: perhaps I knew I was dreaming somehow.\n\t\t\tNext I am at a table with about six other actors: the policeman, a wise but irreverent teenage boy, a woman with blond hair and others I can't remember. We are talking about the movie and our parts. We are about to shoot the movie for real. Suddenly I am afraid that when the movie comes out that those from my past that I wronged would see me and seeing I had achieved success would try to destroy me. Then I thought it was worth it. I would rather have a few glorious days in the sun than a lifetime hiding under a rock somewhere.\n\t\t\tWe shoot the movie. The teenage boy point out a low door. The door leads to a maze that I have only a small amount of time to get through. As I enter the maze, a long haired beggar shouts \"I don't like who you've become!\" And chases me with a knife. He chases me and plunges the knife in my chest. I feel it go in repeatedly.\n\t\t\tI am with mum and dad in England. I have been in this movie for days and with two days to go they are only now getting the chance to see my husband and I and our children. I ask my mum how she feels and she starts to cry as do I.

He keeps us there by pulling in the bleachers. There is a huge drop from where I'm sitting to the ground. I managed to go down four or five rows by slowly lowering myself down. I meet this guy, I can't remember his features. There were two creatures with purple eyes for hands; they can hypnotize people. They were heading into the gym as we tried to escape. I was still on the bleachers when the came in. The guy next to me jumps down to kill it, but he had trouble. I threw a pipe to him, but it doesn't do much. I finally get down to the floor and I stabbed it. To defeat it is to stab something into the eyes, but make sure to make your eyes unfocused and squinted to avoid the effect it has. We then learn that everyone is a monster. The guy who was next to me had glowing green eyes, including the whites were green, and fang and claws for a few second. I was either a pure human since I didn't drink the water or a werewolf. The dream ended before I could confirm either one.",

There were people going back and forth, lots of activities and noise. I wanted to disappear into a quiet corner, but I needed to be visible for when she arrived, as she had the tickets. She arrived just slightly before the event and looked stunning. She was wearing a long white gown that had a slit up one side. I felt all the old feelings for her come back.\n\t\t\tShe smiled and handed me my ticket and we wen to find our seats. The theatre wad dark with just low lights on and most of the people were already in their seats. Again they were all talking and the noise level was making me uncomfortable. We found our seats, which were just padded folding chairs and sat. I admired the architecture of the old theatre. It was beautiful with lots of gold painted on the columns.\n\t\t\tFinally, the man who was performing came out. He wasn't very good.  His jokes weren't all that funny and he had an annoying voice that tended to make me sleepy. I took out a journal and started writing some in it, about my ex and how much I loved her and how I wished that we could be together again. Intermission came and we tried to talk, but she didn't want to, so I went back to writing in my journal.",

I walk behind him to exit the hut. The scene shifts to us all being outside in a courtyard where I am seeking his daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. She is a young girl who is pretty and the thought does occur about how long her prettiness will last and will then perhaps this bond be so useful. But then I remind myself that everything is temporary and that everything changes! In another dream I saw our maid working but she was doing so sloppily and had left the cupboards open. When I woke, I found this cupboard open☺\n\t\t\tIn another sequence, my son is lying on the floor beside his bed with his bed sheet on him while our pet is playing but troubling him. I scold the pet and am anxious to know if my son has fallen down and got hurt. Then I see myself playing with the dog and the thought occurs that our brains are wired to act and therefore even if I am loving to the pet, he will attempt to bite if his animal instinct makes his brain work that way. In another sequence, I am in the bedroom with my wife and son and we are all busy reading etc. Then I let out some gas and everyone is disturbed by it. Even as I don\u2019t own up to it, the smell changes to that of something like plastic burning.\n\t\t\tIn another dream, I am at Shoppers Stop, a big store and I have purchased something, At the payment counter, I realize that I have gift coupons and so pull out some of these \u2013 not covering the entire amount of the purchase, I hold some back. The coupons have expired less than a month ago and the clerk says that they could possibly still be used and that they may just deduct a transaction fee/tax but he will have to get permission from his supervisor. He gets up and goes across to check with the supervisor who looks at us \u2013 me and my son (who is shorter in the dream than in reality). The clerk returns and tries to give some vague answer, indicating that his supervisor has not cleared the request. I ask him to clearly state whether the coupons can be used or not and if there is a need for me to call someone who is high up in his organization and who I know. The scene shifts to the general manager\u2019s office, who happens to be a lady and I think of moving away without asking her but then she calls out to  me and I  go to her with the coupons and remove ALL of them, and ask her if these can somehow still be used.",

The thought occurred that I may get \u2018stuck\u2019 and not be able to move forward, due to fatigue (maybe because I was suffering a back ache in real life). There was some thought regarding the need to prove that I  was healthy again, since my work had recently entailed trekking during a response to a humanitarian crisis in Nepal.\n\t\t\tIn another sequence, my son was settled in to sleep on the front seat of a car, while there were others occupying the other seats to sleep. In a related dream sequence, there were a couple of alcoholics who had got into the driver\u2019s seat and were drinking. I kept telling them that this was my wife\u2019s car and that they could not do this. In an early morning sequence I accompanied a journalist friend to review a famous China Garden restaurant which was being run by celebrity film producer Karan Johar. Because there was no photographer, I was to take photos with a camera. Karan was friendly and I began taking pics of him and a co-owner as they sampled the fare. It was night and I could not get good photos. The catch was that I could not locate the settings in the darkness and was unable to even find the \u2018flash\u2019 even though I managed to \u2018zoom\u2019. I spent a lot of time trying to understand how to work the camera but was unsuccessful and then I mentioned that I could rather use my iPhone which showed good results. Later, a steward was called to take the photos instead and he seemed to have everything figured out!\n\t\t\t(On the previous day, as I had a nap in the afternoon, I had some dreams including one which included a sexual affair. Here I was \u2018caught\u2019 by my son and was trying to explain to him how it was not a sexual act but something else, where I was trying to examine someone with the light of my cellphone \u2013 why I had bright light \u2018on\u2019  in the cellphone at this time, I  do not remember!)",

I showed up at this house and went inside. There was a bed in the living room. I sat on the bed & people started coming in and out of the house and talking to me. One person there who seemed to be wanting to be friends with me was a kid I knew when I was younger. I found out in my dream he had just gotten out of prison. He was trying to convince me that he was a nice person while he was being violent to everyone else in the dream. I had always had a crush on his girlfriend while we were in high school(in real life). There was a super small car parked in the driveway & I joked with my friend who lived at the house about that being his car & that person in real life had just bought a small old car recently in Europe. A group of people were hanging out outside the front door of this house. I decided to leave. I went out the front door & everyone was going out of their way to say goodbye. As I got in my car, everyone else left as well & even though I got into my car first they all seemed to be gone once I had my car in drive. The weather started to get bad & you could see water from the lake start to blow into the road. I drove extremely fast and got back into the town. There I stopped for some reason and went into a bank. I found my little brother sitting in my step dads lap as maybe a 5yr old. He was talking about how I was going to teach him to ski. He came with me as I tried to find an elevator to get back to my car. The elevator wouldn't work and he was scared and I just left him.    The people in this dream were people that I had either talked with very recently or had thought about in the last few weeks. This is the first dream I have recorded & I'm going to have to work on being more specific & to the point if at all possible.",

I couldn't due summer ball and I ended up having 4 knee surgeries for my knee and didn't have a senior season at all.

My mom and the girl who fell's mom were over at a different part of the playground. I went over to \"say hi\" to avoid the instructor. Then, someone called a reporter to put the story on the news.

The dining room has a huge window on one side, and the other side is attached to the living room. I had brought my chair up to the electronic keyboard, which is up against the back of the couch. I was practicing the piece \"O sole mio,\" and enjoying myself very much. \n\t\t\tMy mother was folding clothes on the couch, and my father was sitting next to her watching a football game. My brother was sitting at the dining room table near the window, while he did homework and ate cheese-its. Suddenly, a blinding flash of light shone in through the window, and everyone in the house started shrieking. I threw myself underneath the keyboard I had previously been playing at. A terrible wave of heat swept over me. \n\t\t\tI stayed on the floor, and called out to my brother. There were bright spots dancing behind my closed eyelids, and when I opened my eyes, the spots lingered for several grueling seconds (15-20sec). I stood and reached out to comfort my panicking brother. My parents looked stunned. Then the whole world trembled and all of us were fling to the ground again. The windows shattered, and cracks raced up our cream walls. Glass rained down, but thankfully my brother and I were mostly underneath the table. \n\t\t\tMy hips had slammed against the hardwood floor, and my body flared with pain. I tried to gain purchase on the floor but was hindered by the fact that it was covered in glass shards from our big window. It hurt to move. When I looked at my brother, his hair seemed to be full of tiny glittering crystals. His hair was full of glass.  When I felt water trickling into my clothes, I realized my fish tank had shattered, and all 55 gallons of water were draining onto the floor. I was almost afraid to stand, lest another miraculous force, throw me to earth again. Then I heard screaming coming from outside the house. My family scrambled up and to the door, and when we ran outside there was a great terror in the sky. People had gathered in the street, and were staring at the horizon. Someone was shouting that New York City had been bombed, and there was a great cloud of ash and fire rising in the distance, like the mushroom clouds you see in photographs. My mother sunk to her knees in horror and despair. All I could do was stare at the explosion in revulsion and awe.",

We were infiltrating a base, I believe it was a military or mercenary base, I order to acquire guns. It seemed like I was the leader of this group. My dream shifted towards the end of the job. Apparently we were successful in retrieving the weapons but we alerted the enemy to our presence. We all got the weapons in the truck and began to speed away, but the enemy was not for behind. We tried to kill our pursuers on the road, but they were just out if range. As we drove I noticed a steep heavily forested hill. I told the men that we would should try and lose the enemy and make our way to the hill, then we would spread out and prepare an ambush to kill them. We were able to evade the enemy for a moment and made our way to the hill. We took our positions on the hill and waited to ambush the enemy. I decided to lay down behind a fallen tree for cover. We waited for them, but for some reason the did not come. We thought that they would not show up, but suddenly, almost as if they materialized out of thin air, every one of my men was held at gun point by the enemy. One man, the leader, walked towards each man and told them to surrender, but after he finished with the soldier next to me he tuned toward me and shot me twice, once in the stomach and once in the head. I slumped against the fallen tree, but somehow I survived. I laid there completely still, and hoped that the enemy leader would not notice that I was still alive. As I laid there, it felt like I was leaving my body, I wasn't dead but I could clearly tell that I was looking at myself from a top-down perspective. At this point one of my men shouted my name 3 times and then I woke up from the dream.",

I just didn't want you to have to be. \" The actual dreams by themselves I can decipher on my own, but what doesn't make sense to me is why I keep having them when I really don't feel that way awake.

The loo is rather dark and I have my pillow with me because I am tired and think to myself that I could catch a quick nap. On the way down I am aware of what appears to be my wife at the end of the passage. I make my way to the loo and I put the pillow on the seat of the loo and lie horizontally on my back with my head on the pillow on the loo seat. don't ask me how my body remains suspended. I lie there for a while and am able to sleep for a while. I become aware of someone in the loo next door finishing his business and I also decide that they will start looking for me so I decide to fake the fact that had a no.: 2 and prepare to wipe my butt for the sake of making a bit of noise. To my horror I realise that my butt is rather wet and proceed to wipe it. When complete I take my pillow and make my way up the stairs back to my office. wake up. Very vivid dream.",

I was making errands for a teacher (I don't like the teacher, she shouted at me back then so I'm currently avoiding her when I see her at school, I didn't hold grudges but she kinda scares me.) but in this dream we seemed to get along. I was asked to open the music room when she gave me the keys. I was climbing the stairs to the next floor when the setting changed and we were in my house, I was outside the door, I still have the keys when a tall guy that looked like a foreigner started to climb up the stairs to the 2nd floor which I was on. He had blonde,long hair and was fit. I asked \"Who are you?\" He didn't reply. I asked again, but the only response I got was him bringing out a gun and pointed it at me as he ascended through the stairs. I quickly entered my house, locked the door and called out my dad (he's a law enforcer). \"Open the door! You're not the only one I killed.\" The killer said, My dad quickly got the gun and prepared. There were shots that went through the door and I panicked when my idiotic brother mindlessly passed through the door. Even if we countlessly fought I wouldn't let my brother die in the dream, so I quickly took his hand and saved him. I ran to the veranda and started calling for help from the neighbors, my grandma was out there too. \"Help! There's a killer!\" They just stared at me and resumed talking to themselves. I was irritated but when the gate of the house opened. The killer's face changed. From a hulking man, it changed to a guy, about 18 yrs. old that had a bright blue hoodie. I was shocked I kept pointing at him, my neighbors still confused. I started screaming, \"get him! He's the killer!\" Me in my dream somehow registered in my mind that this killer is capable of changing appearances. The killer just smiled at me and waved a goodbye together with people that also wore blue hoodies and went off.                    -the dream was pretty cool for me haha",

I hate borrowing money from people, I like to be self-sufficient. I kept telling them I would pay them back. \n\t\t\tOn top of all the meter business, I was cheating on my boyfriend.

As we leave the building(yes the house was in a building), we walk into chaos on suburban streets. Several slow walking people pursuing their prey were amidst. Among those not actually alive were several people who were, sort of alive, but the virus(or whatever caused the outbreak) seemed to only make this small gang of folks a bunch of undead bullies. Amongst that group however, was a tall man. This man of unusual height came to be around 7ft tall, with the face of a 70 year old man. His hands had white tape similar to that of a boxer without gloves on. He had a black Dick Tracey style hat with white and grayish long hair protruding down with a matching black trench coat. He spoke with a grunt and moved with a fast walk never running. As we left the house several of these people attacked and I defended with some success which included escape. We followed the panic ridden people on the streets to government supplied busses for transport, immediately after boarding I realized we left our son at my fathers house which in the dream, was somewhat close to my uncles house. I left my sons mother on the bus and embarked on the journey to rescue my 2 year old son which apparently took a few days. The sun rose and set as we(myself and a few strangers) took refuge in several abandoned buildings defending ourselves from the would be killers. During these few days numerous encounters with the main man mention occured, with us barely escaping each time. I severely wounded this dark and tall man but he apparently had quick regenerative abilities which made it difficult to strike any fatal blows. I arrived at my fathers house to find my son all alone by himself. Shortly after the entire family arrived, and the situation was explained. After several stab wounds with my knife to this mans face I grabbed my fathers shotgun  and started firing at the man. I woke up from this dream at about that time, trembling because of how real it felt.",

      "body" : "I dreamt i was outside of church or university and this asian guy in a red leather jacket walked up to me and asked if i wanted cards. I looked at him and gave him this \"why would i want cards\" look and then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a dark blue or purple velvet material type little bag. He asked me to reach in and get the cards but I wouldn't. He then handed the bag to me closer and i looked in and a deck of playing cards with a toy finger on the deck of cards. He was trying to scare me with the finger but i had no reaction. He laughed but i didn't. He then walked me to the church (at this point in my dream it was a church and no longer a university), we didn't say a word but it felt like we were a couple. It felt right being with him but in my dream i was telling myself I couldn't understand this feeling because in my waking life i can never fall for a guy without getting to know him first and so quickly. I also tend to find something wrong with the guy or get bored and move on. So anyway, back to my dream, this guy walked with me to the church, turns out he was going to the same church. By the time we got to the entrance he put his arms on my back and we were a couple. The short walk from outside of the church to the entrance of the church felt like we got to know each other without having to speak a word, it just felt right. So the next scene of my dream i was in a classroom in the church with lots of books, it might have been a library but i think it was more of a classroom. I was looking for the guy (who could have been the love of my life) and he was nowhere to be found. Then a little Caucasian boy with blonde hair (mushroom cut) and blue eyes came up to me and started talking to me. In my dream I somehow felt this little boy was the asian guy i met outside of church except the asian guy was more of my age and he wasn't a little caucasian boy but i knew it was the asian guy i met and fell in love with.

Then he kept asking me if something was going on between us but I insisted no which was true because it was a 1x thing.

I sucked in a deep breath and said hello. She asked me how I was and the conversation flowed quite easily from there.

The dream then switches to my mom. She is wearing a white Arab robe and she is laying on a cheap bed. She then says she is de stressed and I wake up.

      "body" : "Yet another rock music festival.  Camping but staying in someone's house that's on camping grounds.  My phone for taking pics and video is in my white jacket in the pocket.  I'm the last one in the house - everyone has left to go up to the concert area and concessions.  I'm getting ready and there are people just walking in this house like they came to party OR drop off their fricken kids for me to babysit...UHH NOOOOO.  So I keep having to take these kids to find someone else to take care of them.  They're not mine!  (My kids are older by the way 19, 17, 12).  I just really want to get ready and head up there too.  Finally.  I'm ready and people are practically trying to squeeze in the door and I don't know why!!  \"GET OUT\" I yell at all of them.  Then I leave the house and there's a surge of water from the ocean (it's close to the Pacific Ocean and I actually live in the upper Midwest!)  Anyway, the dream takes place just shy of the warm Pacific Coast.  This surge of water is so strong and so large that it covers everything in its path and keeps going and going.  Some people have kayaks or boats and many have nothing.  I am trying to find my phone (?) and I find a floating blow up plastic whale.  Okay then....I get on so I don't drown.  The wave heads back to where it came from.  People are then picking up their wet and destroyed debris.  Well, what they can find.  As for me?  I can't even find the house I'm staying in.  And if I do, I'm not recognizing it.  Another wave...this happens about two or three more times.  I just really want to get to my things:  my jacket and my phone.  Why my phone?  In my dream I wanted to call my loved ones and let them know what's going on and I'm okay.  The fourth time this wave happens, I find something to float on and tell another mom and her kids to 'get on' to be safe.  This one is taking us for a longer ride.  I don't know where we're going.  There's lots of people in the water yelling and screaming and some who look like they're having a good time.  Next thing I know, we come up to a deep hole that we go down in the waterfall on our floaty thing.  Everyone is screaming.  I remember getting extremely scared.  Then I close my eyes in hopes God just takes me before we hit whatever is possibly going to kill us.  We keep falling.  They keep screaming.  I still close my eyes.  I want to die.  I calmly sit hanging on to the handles of the red floaty, scared but accepting of what's to come.  Not knowing what our fate will be.  \"God is there\" I tell myself.  He will take me if I'm to go with Him.  And I felt ready to go with Him.  Then I wake up.  I felt shaken and kind of freaked out.  I live in Northern Minnesota and often dream of the California Coast.  Southern California.  It's usually something somewhat good.  This however was a mixture of a full of fun, exciting, vacation-like rock concert and camping with friends, (something I do once per summer) but up here in Minnesota.  I haven't been to California in 24 years (since age 18).",

A few family members were around, and started to hit my toes with silver spoons. Like it's a greek custom to do so, and it hurt!

They are all happy for us and some are even teasing Roger because they know how happy he is. They take pictures of us and even video. We head to a local disco and I'm sitting passenger in his car. It's dark and the city is alive. We park in a nook only he knows of and begin to walk together with his friends. The the dream takes a turn and we are together at what seemed like a military barrack. We are both being stationed there and head to the mess hall. We enter on the left side of the dining hall and the room is filled with elderly people. As we begin to walk through the room to the food area, Roger accidentally spills coffee on an elderly woman. It was accidentally knocked over and was sitting on the table. She responded by laughing and was very lighthearted. I told him I would get napkins and I set out to help. It took me longer than expected because a sergeant wanted me to give someone papers regarding brain aneurisms so I prioritized it. When I finally got back, I was too late. Roger was already gone. I knew he would leave because I was taking to long so I set out to find him. I searched the male barracks and talked to another tactile officer and he said Roger wasn't there and that his file said he was a little defiant and straight out disobeyed order and got mouthy. I then found an elevator that took me down to a lower level. A female sergeant was in the elevator and asked me if it was worth it and of o knew what I was in for. I said I know exactly why I'm in for and that there's no way I will ever leave he side. She then responded by letting me know \"it's nobody's business\"",

The feeling of us being together is a feeling of completeness. We go out for the night and we're surrounded by hi good friends. They are all happy for us and some are even teasing Roger because they know how happy he is. They take pictures of us and even video. We head to a local disco and I'm sitting passenger in his car. It's dark and the city is alive. We park in a nook only he knows of and begin to walk together with his friends. The the dream takes a turn and we are together at what seemed like a military barrack. We are both being stationed there and head to the mess hall. We enter on the left side of the dining hall and the room is filled with elderly people. As we begin to walk through the room to the food area, Roger accidentally spills coffee on an elderly woman. It was accidentally knocked over and was sitting on the table. She responded by laughing and was very lighthearted. I told him I would get napkins and I set out to help. It took me longer than expected because a sergeant wanted me to give someone papers regarding brain aneurisms so I prioritized it. When I finally got back, I was too late. Roger was already gone. I knew he would leave because I was taking to long so I set out to find him. I searched the male barracks and talked to another tactile officer and he said Roger wasn't there and that his file said he was a little defiant and straight out disobeyed order and got mouthy. I then found an elevator that took me down to a lower level. A female sergeant was in the elevator and asked me if it was worth it and of o knew what I was in for. I said I know exactly why I'm in for and that there's no way I will ever leave he side. She then responded by letting me know \"it's nobody's business\"",

He didn't kiss back because it was just a peck and so I didn't really give him a chance to. Then I remember thinking to myself that it was so strange that he had no reaction to it. He just stood there. Then someone in my group said that we should go to the underground facility because the tornado was getting closer. My dream skipped and I was outside and I was walking next to Derrick. There was some police officers helping us get into the underground facility (it was a separate building). Then Derrick said there was no point going in there because the tornado was already going away. My dream skipped again and I was in a car with Derrick.

      "body" : "I was working from home with modern items, such a computer, but other items felt very 19th century like you get with Steampunk. The lighting always seemed dark even when though it was day outside. I was going about my job when I got a call that I had to go into the city to meet with the owners of the company and a few others. \n\t\t\tI hated having to go into the city in general but really hated it when I had to go to the office. I got dressed up in a pant suit and rode the streetcar down into the city. The city itself felt very 19th century and there was lots of soot blackening out the skies. I wove my way through the crowded streets and there were modern cars as well as older cars and horses and carriages all vying for space, so it was slow going.\n\t\t\tI finally made it to my office. I said hello to the people who had to work in the office and put on a fake smile, as I was not happy to see them. The meeting was boring and unproductive. My mind and my eye kept straying to a window and watching the city move by. Nothing that was discussed had anything to do with my work and nothing was accomplished at the end of the meeting. We shook hands and I headed off to get home. I went back to the bus and train station to catch a ride home, but none of them departed until four in the afternoon and it was only two. I didn't want to stay in the city for two hours, but I didn't see any other option.\n\t\t\tAs I was walking aimlessly around the city, I saw one of my ex-coworkers. We said hello and hugged. She started talking about  her life, what she was doing since she left the company we had both worked for. At one time, I had been interested in dating her and I felt some of that come back, as I was nursing wounds from a lost love. She said, \"Do you have sit back and think and really regret something,\" at that moment a horn sounded from one of the antique cars and she had to stop talking, as nothing could be heard over it. My heart hoped she would say something about relationships that she might be unhappy in her marriage and looking for someone new. I hoped it might be me. Once the car passed and the horn stopped, she turned and laughed a little and ask what she had just said. I reminded her and she said, \"Oh, right, have you ever regretted a professional decision you made?\" \n\t\t\tDisappointed, I nodded. She revealed that she was not happy with her job and was trying to come back to where I worked. I discouraged her letting her know that things had gotten bad there and it wasn't a great place to work that I had been looking for a change. She said that was too bad. She then asked where I was going. I told her I was trying to get home but that nothing was headed that way. She told me that the canoe line was leaving in just a bit and that she was headed that way. I had never heard of the canoe line, but I followed her, as I wanted to leave the city.\n\t\t\tAs we arrived at the station, she transformed into another ex-coworker of mine. She met her two sisters there in line and we joined them. They hugged, talked and laughed and I was largely left out of the conversation. I watched the people in line around us. Except for the four of us, the people in line looked poor, people that worked hard all their lives and never got much for it. I felt guilty and uncomfortable being there. A semi came with a trailer on back. On the open air trailer, there was a massive canoe with many seats. The canoe was old and couldn't be put in the water, but we were to ride in it hauled by the semi. I thought this odd, but boarded, happy to be leaving the city.\n\t\t\tIt turned out that the woman's sisters were in the back of another row and we started the new row. She sat at the front and I was right behind her. The seats had placed in front where there once had been oars. It looked like a slave ship of the old Roman era where the slaves would have rowed massive oars to move the boat along. The oars were gone, but the mechanisms still moved and I played with that as she went on endlessly about her life. I really wasn't listening. We got stopped in a long line of traffic next to a farm that I recognized. I told her about my friend whose horse was there. My friend had died, leaving money to the horse for his care, but now the people wanted to kill him so they could take the money and how we were fighting to save him. She really wasn't interested in what I was saying, but I kept talking anyway. \n\t\t\tAs the semi started moving again, I jumped out of the canoe and off the flatbed. I ran into the fields and no one seemed to care. I had decided that I was going to steal the horse and some others to save them from these awful people. I moved through the field corralling the horses together. They were all horses that I recognized from various farms I have been on during my life.",

I also distinctly remember chatting with dan while eating some tasty fries with the perfect amount of ketchup.",

      "body" : "It started somewhere by the mountains. A brown bear was watching another brown bear, probably the mother bear, playing with her three cubs. Later on, one of the cubs goes astray. Then this black bird (I can't remember if it was an eagle or a vulture or just some big black bird) came swooping down to the lone cub. Luckily, the brown bear who was watching earlier protected this cub. Then there was this Korean guy (I can't remember how he got there. I think his name has the word \"Lee\" in it because there were subtitles.) Suddenly the scene goes to the ocean on a stormy night. The Korean dude, together with the protector bear & lone cub, was in a small boat. Due to the weather & rocky waves, the boat turns and the three goes under water. The protector bear finds the cub nearby and the Korean guy under him, swimming upward, trying to hold on to the protector bear's foot. When he grabs it, the protector bear starts swimming to the surface together with the lone cub. When they have surfaced, the sky was of a different color. It was dark blue with a green-ish tint. The group goes to the land. Then, trampling the bamboos before them, this giant THREE-HEADED LION passes through like a boss (this sucker really stood out).\n\t\t\tDescription of his heads: 1st lion head looked girly. His face was of a normal lion but his mane was like a girl's hair, side parted and straight. He was the only one that roared at the Korean dude's group\n\t\t\t2nd lion head was pretty impassive, not sure if he was sleeping because his eyes were almost closed, so poker faced 3rd lion head was the most reasonable one. He held his head high and looked like a real alpha male\n\t\t\tThen more bamboos were trampled on, the giant feline goes off on his way, not really caring or probably not seeing the group of three that was staring at it in awe and fear. Then suddenly the Korean dude woke up, he was in his room. There was a window which displays a forest. And there was another Korean dude voice talking to him but he didn't have screen time.\n\t\t\tThen I woke up.",

I remember driving on the wrong side of the road and seen the headlights of another car coming our way. I kept thinking I need to move to the other lane but couldn't. However we did not collide. I then went around a curve and seen dead animal parts in the road and slowed down and as we passed there were blue solo cups on the feet and the nose of the dead animals (looked like a deer). We finally made it back to the house and as we were getting out we heard helicopters flying over. We looked up to see what looked like a ship from Star Trek it was painted camo color so I was thinking it was military. The one went in the back yard and was just hovering going up and down as if trying to look in the windows to the house. Lights shining  and it was quite outside. I went in the house and I remember my dad saying \"I'm not going to put up with this shit\".

      "body" : "there may have been some separation between them, but they all came together jumbled like one big tapestry.\n\t\t\tIt started with me being a middle-aged man with underworld connections and lots of weapons. I was helping a younger woman who was multi-racial. She was working on a case  that was very dangerous. We entered a run down barn at night. We had our weapons drawn, as we knew that there would be trouble if we ran into the suspect we were looking for. We caught a glimpse of movement once we entered the barn and then shots rang out. I saw the man briefly, but he was clothed in black with a ski mask on. It was impossible to tell who he was. One of his shots connected with my shoulder and I went down. The dream shifted to my apartment, a highrise in a big city. Again it was night. My shoulder was healing, but still caused pain. The young woman was there and we were discussing what to do next, how to capture the man. I was interested in her romantically, but couldn't tell if she returned that sentiment. I said we had to make a bold statement and at that, we went to the roof where a harrier jet had landed. She protested that it was too big a statement for the middle of a busy city, but I pushed on. We got into the jet and fanned out over the city on our search.\n\t\t\tThen, the jet changed to a commercial airliner where I was me again, with members of my family. We were headed to Disney World for a vacation. We landed and changed in the airport into swimming suits. We headed immediately for a water park as it was a hot day. At the water park, I went down a crazy slide and ended up hitting my head. I nearly drowned, as I was knocked out, but was pulled out just in time and taken to the Disney neurologist. She was very nice, did a lot of tests and said everything looked fine to go back to the fun. She gave me some pain medication in case I needed it and said I should come back for a checkup at some point before we left.\n\t\t\tI went back to the hotel and met up with the rest of the family. The next day, I had an urgent call from the doctor who wanted to see me right away. She had seen something on some of the scans that she didn't like. She said not to worry, it wasn't about the injury, but something else. My mother went with me, but at this point, I had changed yet again. Now I was an ancient, stooped old woman that my mother had to lead by the hand. I stumbled and shuffled into the office completely exhausted. The doctor took me for some more scans and came back and talked to us after a long time. She told me that I had early onset Alzheimer's. She went on and on about how I would need to start planning and then sent me to lunch with my mother at the cafeteria. It was in an old folks home where all of the people had lost their minds. They had to be fed and acted out badly on several occasions. The food was a tasteless mush.\n\t\t\tMy mother and I decided to leave. She guided me out of the building and we went to one of the parks. Once there, she saw some of my siblings and left me. I wondered around a brightly colored area with lots of rides. There was screaming of children and the whir of the machines. Slowly a mist started falling all around. It got so bad that you could hardly see anything. I decided that I might do well to get on a ride since I couldn't see to walk around. As I entered a line for a riverboat type of ride, the fog started to lift and I was myself again, younger and in fine shape. I got to the end of the line and was getting on the boat when my mother and brother showed up. My brother asked if I was really going to ride that. \n\t\t\tI said yes and sat down on the sun warmed boards of the boat. The boat departed and I looked away from my family.",
