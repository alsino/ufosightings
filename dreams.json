Fluid came out an I could see the babys face sticking out, I then tried to keep the baby from coming out so that I could make it to the hospital. Then I gave birth to a big baby girl, and has I went to go breast feed her... I hesitated thinking she isn't hungry because she's a big baby and didn't want to over feed her. A few family members were around, and started to hit my toes with silver spoons. Like it's a greek custom to do so, and it hurt!  I then was in disbelieve that I was pregnant and didn't know how or what to say to my significant other how I didn't know I was pregnant and gave birth. Had a cellphone in my hand but was in shock and confused what to do next.",

So, the balcony of my room now looks to that building (everything looks a bit different from real life too). \n\t\t\tI started to wear my bikini in my room (top was yellow, bottom was orange), but there were two blonde girls in my bed watching me getting dressed. I remember them from a movie I watched some time ago IN REAL LIFE. I got a bit uncomfortable because they were so voyeuristic. When I went down to the pool, the people from the religious building told me that it is inappropriate for me to dress like this, because there will be a prayer in the building soon and people shouldn't see me in bikini. I told them to close their eyes then, or not to look at me. It's easy to solve that problem, right? They have no right to force me into their own view of life. \n\t\t\tAnyway, I swam for a bit, then went back home. When people were leaving the religious building, I was in the balcony. I recognized one of them, it was a guy I see a lot in real life. I never talked to him IN REAL LIFE, but I coincide him a LOT. It kind of started to bother me. He didn't see me in the dream, he was holding a prayer book, and he looked very into it. I both despiced him for being religious, and stalking me (of all the religious buildings in the world, why choose the one opposite my home?).",

The feeling of us being together is a feeling of completeness. We go out for the night and we're surrounded by hi good friends. They are all happy for us and some are even teasing Roger because they know how happy he is. They take pictures of us and even video. We head to a local disco and I'm sitting passenger in his car. It's dark and the city is alive. We park in a nook only he knows of and begin to walk together with his friends. The the dream takes a turn and we are together at what seemed like a military barrack. We are both being stationed there and head to the mess hall. We enter on the left side of the dining hall and the room is filled with elderly people. As we begin to walk through the room to the food area, Roger accidentally spills coffee on an elderly woman. It was accidentally knocked over and was sitting on the table. She responded by laughing and was very lighthearted. I told him I would get napkins and I set out to help. It took me longer than expected because a sergeant wanted me to give someone papers regarding brain aneurisms so I prioritized it. When I finally got back, I was too late. Roger was already gone. I knew he would leave because I was taking to long so I set out to find him. I searched the male barracks and talked to another tactile officer and he said Roger wasn't there and that his file said he was a little defiant and straight out disobeyed order and got mouthy. I then found an elevator that took me down to a lower level. A female sergeant was in the elevator and asked me if it was worth it and of o knew what I was in for. I said I know exactly why I'm in for and that there's no way I will ever leave he side. She then responded by letting me know \"it's nobody's business\"",

She said \"is your room locked up?\"I said \"yeah it is.\"She said \"for how long?\"I replied with I don't know. The conversation ended and now I was on Downelink. Downelink is a social media site for the LGBTQ community. I was on my profile looking at the volume of people that checked my profile out. It was about eight or ten women but the were all private accounts so I couldn't see the pictures.The writing on the app of the website is blue but in my dream the women that checked my profile out,their names that showed up was red and a totally different font. I also had a few new messages in my inbox but for some reason I didn't check it. While I was looking at Downelink I decided to rotate and lay on the opposite side of my bed on my left side with my face and everything else facing the door. All of a sudden my dad came in and I was looking and listening to something. For the life of me I couldn't figure out what it was.So when he started talking I sat up to listen to him while trying to get my phone to silence.It was making a sound of some guy.I think it was Instagram but even when I double clicked on my iPhone to bring all of the pages up that I went on and took the Instagram page off it still was making noise.I put my phone on silent as my father started talking but it wouldn't shut up.He walked in,put his hands on his hips fully dressed in light blue jeans,a paisley/yellowish sweater,and his white and blue NikeSneakers.He said\"I'm going out to the bank to see how much allowance I can give you two girls.\"He was talking about my younger sister Koree and I.He wasn't making sense.He was talking about giving us money but then he went on talking about his his male friend having a hard time right now.At this time I'm still sitting up in my bed trying to figure out why my phone is still talking.I exited out all the apps and it still went on.",

I remember them from a movie I watched some time ago IN REAL LIFE. I got a bit uncomfortable because they were so voyeuristic. When I went down to the pool, the people from the religious building told me that it is inappropriate for me to dress like this, because there will be a prayer in the building soon and people shouldn't see me in bikini. I told them to close their eyes then, or not to look at me. It's easy to solve that problem, right? They have no right to force me into their own view of life. \n\t\t\tAnyway, I swam for a bit, then went back home. When people were leaving the religious building, I was in the balcony. I recognized one of them, it was a guy I see a lot in real life. I never talked to him IN REAL LIFE, but I coincide him a LOT. It kind of started to bother me. He didn't see me in the dream, he was holding a prayer book, and he looked very into it.

It's dark and the city is alive. We park in a nook only he knows of and begin to walk together with his friends. The the dream takes a turn and we are together at what seemed like a military barrack. We are both being stationed there and head to the mess hall. We enter on the left side of the dining hall and the room is filled with elderly people. As we begin to walk through the room to the food area, Roger accidentally spills coffee on an elderly woman. It was accidentally knocked over and was sitting on the table. She responded by laughing and was very lighthearted. I told him I would get napkins and I set out to help. It took me longer than expected because a sergeant wanted me to give someone papers regarding brain aneurisms so I prioritized it. When I finally got back, I was too late. Roger was already gone. I knew he would leave because I was taking to long so I set out to find him. I searched the male barracks and talked to another tactile officer and he said Roger wasn't there and that his file said he was a little defiant and straight out disobeyed order and got mouthy. I then found an elevator that took me down to a lower level. A female sergeant was in the elevator and asked me if it was worth it and of o knew what I was in for. I said I know exactly why I'm in for and that there's no way I will ever leave he side. She then responded by letting me know \"it's nobody's business\"",

She said \"is your room locked up?\"I said \"yeah it is.\"She said \"for how long?\"I replied with I don't know. The conversation ended and now I was on Downelink. Downelink is a social media site for the LGBTQ community. I was on my profile looking at the volume of people that checked my profile out. It was about eight or ten women but the were all private accounts so I couldn't see the pictures.The writing on the app of the website is blue but in my dream the women that checked my profile out,their names that showed up was red and a totally different font. I also had a few new messages in my inbox but for some reason I didn't check it. While I was looking at Downelink I decided to rotate and lay on the opposite side of my bed on my left side with my face and everything else facing the door. All of a sudden my dad came in and I was looking and listening to something. For the life of me I couldn't figure out what it was.So when he started talking I sat up to listen to him while trying to get my phone to silence.It was making a sound of some guy.I think it was Instagram but even when I double clicked on my iPhone to bring all of the pages up that I went on and took the Instagram page off it still was making noise.I put my phone on silent as my father started talking but it wouldn't shut up.He walked in,put his hands on his hips fully dressed in light blue jeans,a paisley/yellowish sweater,and his white and blue NikeSneakers.He said\"I'm going out to the bank to see how much allowance I can give you two girls.\"He was talking about my younger sister Koree and I.He wasn't making sense.He was talking about giving us money but then he went on talking about his his male friend having a hard time right now.At this time I'm still sitting up in my bed trying to figure out why my phone is still talking.I exited out all the apps and it still went on.",
